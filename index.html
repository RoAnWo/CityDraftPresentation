                    Aim and Context:

                <p>
                    Our overarching aim is to create a rapid draft generator for user-defined urban development areas.<br />
			<br />
			This tool opens up the possibility of prototyping very experimental urban planning strategies fast and efficiently. In this context, the aforementioned <br />
			algorithm demonstrates potentials and influences of different prerequisites like population density, amount of greenspaces, street layouts and much more.<br />
			<br />
			Especially in the context of current challenges in urban planning like urban transformation, the current restructuring of car-based infrastructure,<br /> 
			growing inequality among residents of urban areas, but also during an emerging stream of new ideas and techniques in this field, this tool can help <br />
			to visualize and compare different scenarios with differing social and cultural base parameters and requirements.<br />
			In addition, it can help planners to interconnect parameters and requirements that might be hard to identify and measure in early planning stages. <br />
			While this tool certainly isn't meant to produce finished plans, it can be used by urban planners to build upon and be used as an initiator for<br />
			digitally informed urban designs.<br />
			<br />
			Last but not least, in an age of a growing interest in participatory planning and a broader inclusion of the general public in urban planning,<br />
			due to its low entry threshold, this tool can provide a valuable resource to visualize different concepts of urban planning and to let people otherwise<br />
			not affiliated with this topic get involved in the early planning stages of projects, while playing with an experimental, but realistic environment.<br
