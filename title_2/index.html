                <p>The blue function takes a Set of Lines as an Input and searches for all "plots" enclosed by lines. 
			It does that by following a line starting from any point on the outer line and always moving clockwise to the next connecting line.<br />
			If there is more then one line connecting it will turn left for finding an outline, and continue to do so until it reaches a visited point again.
			And it will turn right to find an enclosed plot, starting from any outline and continue to turn right until it reaches a visited point again.<br />
			Then the parts of the enclosed plot that were part of the Outline are removed for the new Input, until all Plots are found. Those will be passed on to
			the red function.<br />This is currently generating a faulty output, as it has trouble finding the loops correctly.<br />
			The green function searches for the neighbouring plots, it does that by looking for all the plots that share 2 or more coordinates with the current plot.
			it outputs the result in a List like this [PlotNr[Neighbouring Plots]] and passes it on to the red function.<br /><br />
			The red function first declares a list of possible values and their respective weight and also declares the count of each value as 0. Then it selects the first
			plot in the dictionary and assigns a random value chosen from the list of possible values to that plot in the dictionary. <br />
			The function then loops through the plots in the dictionary and for each plot, it loops through its corresponding list of neighbors. For each neighbor, 
			it checks the value assigned to that neighbor and based on that it may remove a certain values from the list of possible values.<br />
			If a certain value reaches a set threshold, the function may remove that from possible values.
			The function then assigns random value to each plot in the dictionary from the possible values (list) but with the updated weight.<br />
			It also keeps track of the count of each value assigned. The function then returns the modified dictionary with assigned values.
