                This part of the algorithm takes user-defined vertices that define the boundary of the building site and input lines, also placeable by the user, <br />
		that serve as starting points for the generation of the main street network. The main streets are generated by first checking if the individual input<br />
		lines provided by the user would generate valid streets. If this is the case, the algorithm calculates possible intersections with the boundary line<br />
		and generates generation starting points with accompanying direction vectors out of the given information.<br />
		Next, a recursive algorithm iterates through the list of starting points and direction vectors and starts generating streets out of them. The length <br />
		of the currently generated street is increased for each iteration until an intersection with the boundary or another street is detected. Then, a final<br />
		street is generated out of the starting point and intersection point and appended to a list of streets.<br />
		In preparation for the following parts of the algorithm, these street segments are then divided by every other generated street segment so that every street<br />
		ends at every point it crosses.<br />
		Current Challenges include the user input which at some point is supposed to be achieved through THREE TransformControls to make vertices of the base shape<br />
		click- and draggable, as well as the generation of a secondary street network which is not yet realized. The secondary street network is supposed to be created <br />
		by extracting and offsetting the plots generated from the main streets and then subdividing these by placing additional streets. <br />
